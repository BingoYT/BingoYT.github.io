      <h1>About me</h1> <br>
      <p id = > My name is Alex. I'm 16 years of age and currently living in Kharkiv, Ukraine. I am one of those who like maths and coding. But what I really love doing is setting up new challenges and completing them before the specific term. I'm an aspired computer science student whose goal is to become a data scientist. Here is the list of my favourite subjects in school:</p>
    <div class = 'row'>
      <div class = 'col'>
        <h3> Maths </h3>
        <p>Maths is by far my favourite school subject. There are some things I utterly hate in it. They are: proofs of theorems and theoretical lectures. However, what makes me on cloud nine is the feeling of solving the problem I couldn't figure out for ages.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = 'col'>
        <h3> Computing </h3>
        <p>Computing (in our country it's called <b>Informatics</b>) is also one of my favourite school subjects. It was quite a surprise for me that I like it as I always considered it as some boring coding thing. Actually, that's what I'm doing right now! :)</p>
      </div>
      <div class = 'col'>
        <h3> Foreign Languages </h3>
        <p>At the age of about 8 I realised my talent when it comes to foreign languages. It sounds implausible, but two years ago I couldn't speak English at all. Now, as I started to attend extra classes, my English became more fluent and in some way advanced.</p>

    <section class = 'hobbies' id = 'hobbies'>
      <h1>My hobbies</h1> 
    <div class = 'row'>
      <div class = 'col'>
        <h3> Solving maths problems </h3>
        <p>Just like I mentioned before, I like the feeling of having a hard problem solved.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = 'col'>
        <h3> Coding stuff </h3>
        <p>I simply like coding :)</p>
      </div>
      <div class = 'col'>
        <h3> Playing video games </h3>
        <p>Among my favourite computer games are: PUBG Mobile, ZombsRoyale.io, Clash of Clans etc. </p>
